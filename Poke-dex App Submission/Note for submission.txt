Hey students,
This folder is for Poke-dex App submission.  For submission create a folder with your name (preferably) or roll number. In that folder there must be 2 folders:  1 for the app folder and other for the output folder. Output can be either screen recording of the emulator or screenshot.

The directory tree should be like below: 
<Name>
|----  <App name>
|----  <output folder >
